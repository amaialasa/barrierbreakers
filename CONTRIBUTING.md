# Contributing
Please follow a few guidelines in order to contribute to the project:

1. Pick an issue in the backlog and assign it to yourself.
2. Always create a new branch `git branch branch_name` and all changes you make should be in that branch.
3.  Make the changes needed then save and commit them:
	- Use `git status` to see what changes there are that can be committed.
	- To add a file to be commited: ```git add filename``` *(this will stage the file for a commit)*
	- Once all files you want to commit are added you can  commit the changes ```git commit``` and make sure to add a meaningful message to describe what changes you have made.
4. [Raise a Pull Request](## How to raise a Pull Request
) so other teammembers can review the changes before they are merged5. 
5. Have at least 1 team member review your code *(ideally 2)* and once you receive a :+1: you can merge the code.
